# Welcome!

This is a public, [whitelisted](#whitelisting) Minecraft server with an emphasis on community in a vanilla Minecraft setting.
We run a single survival world at "hard" difficulty.
The server is running Minecraft ([Paper](https://github.com/PaperMC/Paper)) 1.15.2.
We started Tranquility after a favorite server, Serenity-MC.org, stopped operating.
We base Tranquility's general feel and our [Code of Conduct](#code-of-conduct) on the Serenity server.
"Tranquility" made a great name, because it has the same meaning as "Serenity", because "T" comes right after "S" alphabetically, and because [Tranquility Base](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tranquility_Base) is the first place humans landed when we left earth --- Tranquility is the first place some Serenity players landed when we left that server.

Tranquility is a vanilla-like server.
We use plugins to enhance the community aspects of the game, prevent griefing, and remove some minor annoyances from the vanilla experience.
Our server uses the following plugins and data packs:

- [AFK Display](https://vanillatweaks.net/picker/datapacks/): turns player names gray when they are afk
- [Coordinates HUD](https://vanillatweaks.net/picker/datapacks/): shows the player their coordinates and the current time
- [Customizable Armor Stands](https://vanillatweaks.net/picker/datapacks/): allows positioning of armor stands
- [DiscordSRV](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/discordsrv.18494/): join us in the [Discord](https://tranquility.one/discord)!
- [Dynmap](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/dynmap.274/): check out our real-time updating [map](https://tranquility.one/map)!
- [GriefPrevention](https://github.com/TechFortress/GriefPrevention/): claim an area [with a golden shovel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDsjXB-BaE0) to protect your things from other players
- [Dynmap-GriefPrevention](https://github.com/webbukkit/Dynmap-GriefPrevention): our map shows claimed areas
- [Multiplayer Sleep](https://github.com/Plagiatus/datapacks/tree/master/multiplayer_sleep): only 10% of the online players need to be in bed to cause dawn
- [Pillager Tools](https://vanillatweaks.net/picker/datapacks/)
  - Pillager patrols are disabled
  - Pillagers still spawn naturally (at night and at their outpost)
  - Raids can still occur after you defeat an outpost leader
- SereneMail (custom mailboxes and delivery service from Serenity-MC.org):
  - Create a mailbox by placing a chest on a fencepost
  - Put items in it and type `/mailto <player_name>` to send the items to them
  - Hearts above your mailbox mean _you've got mail!_

# Code of Conduct

> Be excellent to each other, and party on!

> _Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure_

Treat others as you would prefer to be treated.
We don't have time for hateful speech; not sorry.
Don't mess with anyone else's stuff, whether they've protected it or not.
Don't needlessly destroy the environment in common areas.
This includes "pillaring up" and leaving your pillars standing all over the map.

Have fun!
This server is for everyone's enjoyment.

> I strive to treat all Tranquility players with love, following the example of Jesus Christ.
> While worshipping God as I do is never required on Tranquility, we do require respect for everyone &mdash; God made us all in His image.
> If you're interested in my faith, please ask.
> I would love to share with you!

# Notable Builds

Our current world is new enough that there aren't many builds out there.
There is a trading village at (750, -25), and you can check out the skeleton and zombie farms by heading down the tunnel at (805, -31).
DaleHouseden has started a cathedral near (935, 522) &mdash; his Serenity Cathedral was legendary.
