This is a public, [whitelisted](#whitelisting) Minecraft server with an emphasis on community in a vanilla Minecraft setting.
Currently we run a single survival world at "hard" difficulty.
The server is running Minecraft ([Paper](https://github.com/PaperMC/Paper)) version `1.14.3`.
We started this server after a favorite server, **Serenity-MC.org**, stopped operating.
Tranquility's general feel is based on Serenity, as is our [Code of Conduct](#code-of-conduct).
**Hal**, if you're out there, we'd love to have you play here!

Tranquility is a vanilla-like server.
We use plugins to enhance the community aspects of the game, prevent griefing, and remove some minor annoyances from the vanilla experience.
Our server uses the following plugins and datapacks:

* [DiscordSRV](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/discordsrv.18494/)
* [Dynmap](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/dynmap.274/)
* [Multiplayer Sleep](https://github.com/Plagiatus/datapacks/tree/master/multiplayer_sleep)

## Code of Conduct

> Be excellent to each other, and party on!

> Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure

Treat others as you would prefer to be treated.
We don't have time for hateful speech; not sorry.
Don't mess with anyone else's stuff, whether they've protected it or not.
Don't needlessly destroy the environment, especially in common areas (to include "pillaring up" and leaving your pillars standing all over the map).

Have fun!
This server is for everyone's enjoyment.

### Whitelisting

There is no automated system for whitelisting.
Contact StickFig in the [Discord](discord) for more information.
Please read the [Code of Conduct](#code-of-conduct) before you apply.
