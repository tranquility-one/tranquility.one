# Welcome!

This is a public, [whitelisted](#whitelisting) Minecraft server.
We run a single survival world at "hard" difficulty.
The server is running Minecraft ([Paper](https://papermc.io)) 1.21.1.
We started Tranquility after a favorite server, Serenity-MC.org, stopped operating.
We base Tranquility's general feel and our [Code of Conduct](#code-of-conduct) on the Serenity server.
"Tranquility" made a great name: it has the same meaning as "Serenity", "T" comes right after "S" alphabetically, and [Tranquility Base](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tranquility_Base) is the first place humans landed when we left earth --- Tranquility is the first place some Serenity players landed when we left that server.

Tranquility is a vanilla-like server.
We use plugins to enhance the community aspects of the game, reduce griefing, and remove annoyances from the vanilla experience.
Tranquility runs the following plugins and data packs:

- [Armor Statues](https://vanillatweaks.net/picker/datapacks/): [modify the settings and pose of armor stands](https://hermitcraft.fandom.com/wiki/Armor_Statues_Datapack).
- [Bluemap](https://bluemap.bluecolored.de/) gives us a [3D model](https://tranquility.one/3d) of our world, right in the browser!
  It shows claimed areas using [BlueBridge](https://github.com/Mark-225/BlueBridge).
- [Better Craftables](https://modrinth.com/datapack/better-craftables): extra crafting recipes for quality of life
- [Burning Flesh](https://modrinth.com/datapack/burning-flesh/version/v1.10.0): fuel your furnace with arrows or rotten flesh
- [Coordinates HUD](https://vanillatweaks.net/picker/datapacks/): type `/trigger ch_toggle` to turn on a heads-up display of your coordinates and the current time
- [DiscordSRV](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/discordsrv.18494/): join us in the [Discord](https://tranquility.one/discord)!
  We have channels for online, offline, and off-topic discussion, plus one for screenshots.
- [Dynmap](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/dynmap.274/): check out the [world map](https://tranquility.one/map) (which shows claimed areas using [GriefPreventionDynmap](https://github.com/leahshields95/GriefPreventionDynmap))
- [GriefPrevention](https://github.com/TechFortress/GriefPrevention/): claim an area [with a golden shovel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDsjXB-BaE0) to protect your things from other players
- [Pillager Tools](https://vanillatweaks.net/picker/datapacks/)
  - Pillager patrols are disabled
  - Pillagers still spawn naturally (at night and at their outpost)
  - Raids can still occur after you defeat an outpost leader
- SereneMail (custom mailboxes and delivery service from Serenity-MC.org):
  - Create a mailbox by placing a chest on a fencepost
  - Put items in it and type `/mailto <player_name>` to send the items to them
  - Hearts above your mailbox mean _you've got mail!_
- [Sleep-Most](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/sleep-most-1-8-1-16-1-configurable-messages-and-percentage.60623/): only half the players need to sleep to skip the night

We recommend players use the [Optifine](https://optifine.net/) client mod for best performance.
