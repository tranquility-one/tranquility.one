# Welcome!

This is a public, [whitelisted](#whitelisting) Minecraft server with an emphasis on community in a vanilla Minecraft setting.
Currently we run a single survival world at "hard" difficulty.
The server is running Minecraft ([Paper](https://github.com/PaperMC/Paper)) version `1.14.4`.
We started this server after a favorite server, **Serenity-MC.org**, stopped operating.
Tranquility's general feel is based on Serenity, as is our [Code of Conduct](#code-of-conduct).

Tranquility is a vanilla-like server.
We use plugins to enhance the community aspects of the game, prevent griefing, and remove some minor annoyances from the vanilla experience.
Our server uses the following plugins and datapacks:

* [AFK Display](https://vanillatweaks.net/picker/datapacks/)
* [Coordinates HUD](https://vanillatweaks.net/picker/datapacks/)
* [Customizable Armor Stands](https://vanillatweaks.net/picker/datapacks/)
* [DiscordSRV](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/discordsrv.18494/)
* [Dynmap](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/dynmap.274/)
* [Dynmap-GriefPrevention](https://github.com/webbukkit/Dynmap-GriefPrevention)
* [GriefPrevention](https://github.com/TechFortress/GriefPrevention/)
* [Multiplayer Sleep](https://github.com/Plagiatus/datapacks/tree/master/multiplayer_sleep)
* [Pillager Tools](https://vanillatweaks.net/picker/datapacks/)
* SereneMail (custom mailboxes and delivery from **Serenity-MC.org**)

## Code of Conduct

> Be excellent to each other, and party on!

> Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure

Treat others as you would prefer to be treated.
We don't have time for hateful speech; not sorry.
Don't mess with anyone else's stuff, whether they've protected it or not.
Don't needlessly destroy the environment, especially in common areas (to include "pillaring up" and leaving your pillars standing all over the map).

Have fun!
This server is for everyone's enjoyment.

> I strive to treat all Tranquility players with love, following the example of Jesus Christ.
> While worshipping God as I do is never a requirement for playing on Tranquility, we do require respect for everyone &mdash; all are made in the image of God.
> If you're interested in my faith, please ask.
> I would love to share with you!

## Notable Builds

Our current world is new enough that there just aren't that many builds out there.
However, you can check out the skeleton XP farm by heading down the tunnel at `(824, -92)`.
DaleHouseden has started a cathedral (his Serenity Cathedral was legendary) around `(935, 522)`.
DoctorLokiGrey and peanuthead159 have a large walled village near `(-465, -1415)`.
