### Welcome

This is a public, [whitelisted](#whitelisting) Minecraft server with an emphasis on community in a vanilla Minecraft setting.
We run a single survival world at "hard" difficulty.
The server is running Minecraft ([Paper](https://github.com/PaperMC/Paper)) 1.15.1.
We started Tranquility after a favorite server, Serenity-MC.org, stopped operating.
We base Tranquility's general feel and our [Code of Conduct](#code-of-conduct) on the Serenity server.

Tranquility is a vanilla-like server.
We use plugins to enhance the community aspects of the game, prevent griefing, and remove some minor annoyances from the vanilla experience.
Our server uses the following plugins and data packs:

* [AFK Display](https://vanillatweaks.net/picker/datapacks/)
* [Coordinates HUD](https://vanillatweaks.net/picker/datapacks/)
* [Customizable Armor Stands](https://vanillatweaks.net/picker/datapacks/)
* [DiscordSRV](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/discordsrv.18494/)
* [Dynmap](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/dynmap.274/)
* [Dynmap-GriefPrevention](https://github.com/webbukkit/Dynmap-GriefPrevention)
* [GriefPrevention](https://github.com/TechFortress/GriefPrevention/)
* [Multiplayer Sleep](https://github.com/Plagiatus/datapacks/tree/master/multiplayer_sleep)
* [Pillager Tools](https://vanillatweaks.net/picker/datapacks/)
* SereneMail (custom mailboxes and delivery service from Serenity-MC.org)

### Code of Conduct

> Be excellent to each other, and party on!

> <cite>Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure</cite>

Treat others as you would prefer to be treated.
We don't have time for hateful speech; not sorry.
Don't mess with anyone else's stuff, whether they've protected it or not.
Don't needlessly destroy the environment in common areas.
This includes "pillaring up" and leaving your pillars standing all over the map.

Have fun!
This server is for everyone's enjoyment.

> I strive to treat all Tranquility players with love, following the example of Jesus Christ.
> While worshipping God as I do is never required on Tranquility, we do require respect for everyone &mdash; God made us all in His image.
> If you're interested in my faith, please ask.
> I would love to share with you!
