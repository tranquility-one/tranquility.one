# Welcome!

This is a public, [whitelisted](#whitelisting) Minecraft server with an emphasis on community in a vanilla Minecraft setting.
Currently we run a single survival world at "hard" difficulty.
The server is running Minecraft ([Paper](https://github.com/PaperMC/Paper)) version `1.14.2`.
We started this server after a favorite server, **Serenity-MC.org**, stopped operating.
Tranquility's general feel is based on Serenity, as is our [Code of Conduct](#code-of-conduct).
**Hal**, if you're out there, we'd love to have you play here!

Tranquility is a vanilla-like server.
We use plugins to enhance the community aspects of the game, prevent griefing, and remove some minor annoyances from the vanilla experience.
Our server uses the following plugins and datapacks:

* [DiscordSRV](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/discordsrv.18494/)
* [Dynmap](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/dynmap.274/) with [Dynmap-GriefPrevention](https://github.com/webbukkit/Dynmap-GriefPrevention)
* [GriefPrevention](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/griefprevention.1884/)
* [Multiplayer Sleep](https://github.com/Plagiatus/datapacks/tree/master/multiplayer_sleep)

## Code of Conduct

> Be excellent to each other, and party on!

> Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure

Treat others as you would prefer to be treated.
We don't have time for hateful speech; not sorry.
Don't mess with anyone else's stuff, whether they've protected it or not.
Don't needlessly destroy the environment, especially in common areas (to include "pillaring up" and leaving your pillars standing all over the map).

Have fun!
This server is for everyone's enjoyment.

### Whitelisting

There is no automated system for whitelisting.
Contact StickFig in the [Discord](discord) for more information.
Please read the [Code of Conduct](#code-of-conduct) before you apply.

## Land Claims

The GriefPrevention plugin allows for an [excellent land claim system](https://youtu.be/VDsjXB-BaE0); it is in use on our server.
Each player receives a small claim centered on the first chest they place.
Additional claims can be made using a golden shovel.
Each player has a limit for how much area they can claim, which increases by 100 square blocks for every hour the player spends on the server.
Within a claim, explosions will not damage blocks, and endermen do not pick blocks up.
The owner of a claim can set permissions for other players to merely access (doors, buttons, and switches), open containers, or even build within their claim.
It is also possible to create multiple subclaims within a larger claim --- to [create a multi-player town](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3FLCFam5LI), for instance.

### Spawn Area

The area from `(-150, -150)` to `(150, 150)` is protected by an administrative claim; all players may walk freely through it, open doors, push buttons, and open containers, but no one may build there without specific permission.
If you want to build something at spawn, contact StickFig to set up a subclaim that you will have control over.
The server's City Hall is located at `53, 72, 9`, which is where new players spawn on first join.
A portal to the Nether Hub is at `26, 73, 9`; the Hub itself is at `N -10, 99, 0`.
[DaleHousden](https://namemc.com/profile/DaleHousden.1) is responsible for both; he's done a fantastic job!
