## Background
The [Tranquility](https://tranquility.one) Minecraft server was built after the [Serenity](https://serenity-mc.org) server was closed. This repository holds the server website, a simple Hugo build.

## Install
Clone this repository, and enter the top-level directory. `hugo server` will run the server; `hugo` will build the website for deployment.

## Usage
For development, use `hugo server -wDd dev` to [avoid building draft content in production](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/usage/#dev-vs-deploy-destinations).

For deployment, use `hugo`, then copy the contents of the `public` folder to your web root.
