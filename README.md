## Background
This is a project to learn Hugo by building a barebones website without any generators. It will include a custom theme. Initially the project will follow [A Gentle Introduction to Creating a Minimal Hugo Site](https://arunrocks.com/minimal-hugo-site-tutorial/), though it will probably progress from there.

## Install
Clone this repository, and enter the top-level directory. `hugo server` will run the server; `hugo` will build the website for deployment.

## Usage
For development, use `hugo server -wDd dev` to [avoid building draft content in production](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/usage/#dev-vs-deploy-destinations).

For deployment, use `hugo`, then copy the contents of the `public` folder to your web root.
